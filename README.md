## The Clean Heat Program
##### The NYC Clean Heat program advocates for sustainable heating and cooling, emphasizing the use of heat pumps to eliminate reliance on fossil fuels, benefiting both the environment and individual health. It encourages the installation of various heat pump technologies. The discussion also touches upon the environmental impact of different fuel oils and introduces initiatives like the DEP Boiler Registration and the Greener Greater Buildings Plan, aimed at reducing pollution and enhancing energy efficiency in NYC buildings. The transition to clean heating fuels is highlighted, stressing the need for careful decision-making, proper financing, and effective management to ensure a smooth and environmentally conscious shift in the building sector.


# Facts & Data on NYC EMISSIONS
##### The Climate Mobilization Act of 2019 in New York City aims to curb carbon emissions from buildings, with only 25% having an A energy efficiency rating. More than 40% of the energy used in city buildings is used for heating and cooling, which greatly increases the city's greenhouse gas emissions. Particularly in the United States, air conditioning is becoming more and more popular. This increases electricity use and puts the environment at risk from refrigerant leaks. According to a recent bill in New York, fossil fuels will not be allowed in new construction beginning in 2026 for smaller buildings and 2029 for larger ones. The Brooklyn Public Library achieved a 40% reduction in emissions through sustainable measures, making Brooklyn an excellent example of local efforts to reduce emissions. Through programs like lending Home Energy Audit Toolkits to library users and promoting energy-saving techniques, they also involve the public in sustainability.


# Analying Fuel Data
##### We came across the Types of Fuel Oils (No. 4 and No. 6) when examining the data for the NYC Clean Heat Program in HC 3. No. 6 was found to cause more environmental harm because it is a heavy fuel used in power plants and ships. These conclusions from our research are supported by the fact that Brooklyn neighborhoods like Flatbush, Brooklyn Heights, Ocean Parkway, and Borough Park use fuel oil of type No. 6, which contributes to fuel consumption that is equal to or greater than that of other neighborhoods. Because Brooklyn is a relatively new borough, its usage may be lower than that of other boroughs.

#### We can see from the data below that the Total MMBTU (High) usage is significantly higher in zip code 11238 which can be due to a variety of reason but, its most likely due to the higher population in that area of about 10,000 more residents.
